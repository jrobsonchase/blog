After watching James Munns' [Something for
Nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99L3JHhLc0) talk at RustConf about
all of the cool things in the embedded Rust world that have been going on, I
decided to take a crack at some embedded work. I built an
[ErgoDox](https://www.ergodox.io/) a while back and already had some basic
understanding of how its keyboard controller operates, so I thought "why not
design my own keyboard?"

<!-- more -->

Disclaimer: I'm mostly a newbie at embedded development short of a few
classes I took back in college that mostly involved developing for the
[68HC11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freescale_68HC11) and
[6800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800), both of which were
released in the 80's. Yikes. Anyway, take all of this with a grain of salt! ðŸ™‚

## Selecting A Controller

Having worked with the [Teensy 2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html)
for my ErgoDox, I originally planned to use the ARM-based [Teensy
LC](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html) for my controller. Since there
wasn't much in the way of device or board support for it in the embedded rust
world, I went down the rabbit hole of building it mostly from the ground up.

I got as far as generating the [device
crate](https://gitlab.com/jrobsonchase/mkl26z4) via
[svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust) and started on the
[board support crate](https://gitlab.com/jrobsonchase/teensy-lc) before
hitting a snag. I disregarded this bit in the example `memory.x` from the [Rust Embedded Book](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/):

```
/* You can use this symbol to customize the location of the .text section */
/* If omitted the .text section will be placed right after the .vector_table
   section */
/* This is required only on microcontrollers that store some configuration right
   after the vector table */
/* _stext = ORIGIN(FLASH) + 0x400; */
```

Everything *looked* to be going alright - I had a basic "blink" program that
I could build and load that seemed to work for the most part, but then I
decided to add an interrupt handler. This was apparently enough to brick my
Teensy. The chip on the Teensy-LC, the MKL26Z64VFT4, has a small flash-config
section inside the main flash region of memory, which is what the comment in
the `memory.x` example alluded to.

As far as I could tell, I managed to either load some bad data into that
region when flashing my board (which the teensy bootloader is supposed to
prevent), my running code somehow managed to touch it, or something else
entirely went wrong. At any rate, my first Teensy-LC stopped showing up as a
USB device even when the reset button was pressed. As a part of my debugging
process, I flashed the same program to my second Teensy-LC to make sure that
it was in fact my program that had killed it and not some other electrical
issue I may have induced. Turns out I was right, and both boards were now
inoperable. Whoops.

{{ image(path="flash-config.jpg", alt="Flash Config Section") }}

I created a [thread on the PJRC
forum](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/54000-Seemingly-bricked-Teensy-LC-with-Rust)
in hopes that someone would have some ideas for me, or perhaps some
replacement boards since, from what I gathered, it wasn't supposed to be
possible to brick them in this manner. Alas, no replies.

### Designing for Debuggability

One of the major failings of the Teensy family is their lack of an accessible
hardware debugging interface. While the core microcontroller technically has
a debugging interface, it's "hijacked" by the bootloader/flasher coprocessor,
making it unusable without [some
hacking](https://mcuoneclipse.com/2014/08/09/hacking-the-teensy-v3-1-for-swd-debugging/)
that I didn't feel up for, especially since I had already killed two boards.
I suspect that if I had a real debugging interface to connect to, I might
have been able to recover them, but since the proprietary incommunicado
bootloader was the only way to program them, I was out of luck.

I'd always heard great things about the STM32 family and their debuggability,
in addition to pre-existing Rust support, so I went looking for a suitable
board in that vein. I pretty quickly found the [stm32duino
wiki](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php) and their list of [STM32F103
boards](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=STM32F103_boards). The
RobotDyn "Black Pill" seemed like it would do the trick, so I grabbed 5 of
them from [their
site](https://robotdyn.com/stm32f103-stm32-arm-mini-system-dev-board-stm-firmware.html).

## Running Some Code

A simple "blink" program is usually a good first pass at any embedded
development target. I've been using [the one from the stm32f103xx-hal
crate](https://github.com/japaric/stm32f103xx-hal/blob/master/examples/blinky.rs).
The setup of the Rust project is covered pretty thoroughly in the [Embedded
Book](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/), so I won't go into much detail
on it here.

The STM32 family comes with their own built-in bootloader that supports
flashing over pretty much any serial peripheral, such as I2C or UART. I
happened to have [one of
these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QT7LQ88/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
USB to TTL cables laying around, so that made flashing the boards pretty
straightforward.

{{ video(path="blink") }}

In the above video, RX and TX are connected to PA9 and PA10 respectively and
3v3/GND to their respective pins. With that set up, the blink program
can be flashed with `stm32flash`:

```bash
$ stm32flash -w blink.bin -v -g 0x0 /dev/ttyUSB0
stm32flash 0.5

http://stm32flash.sourceforge.net/

Using Parser : Raw BINARY
Interface serial_posix: 57600 8E1
Version      : 0x22
Option 1     : 0x00

Device ID    : 0x0410 (STM32F10xxx Medium-density)
- RAM        : 20KiB  (512b reserved by bootloader)
- Flash      : 128KiB (size first sector: 4x1024)
- Option RAM : 16b
- System RAM : 2KiB
Write to memory
Erasing memory
Wrote and verified address 0x0abcdef0 (100.00%) Done.
```

For this, the BOOT0 pin (closest to the USB port) needs to be jumpered high
when the board is powered up. This puts the device into bootloader mode. In
order to actually run the code, the board needs to be started with BOOT0
jumpered low. This is obviously a bit of a pain when trying to iterate
quickly. Luckily, it's not (usually) necessary when you have a real debugger.

## Buliding The Debugger

Running code is fun and all, but what I *really* wanted was a way to debug
it. Enter [Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki).

Black Magic Probe is an open-source on-chip-debugger that runs its own GDB
server, so it doesn't require any additional tooling on the host side. It
runs on [quite a
few](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki/Debugger-Hardware)
platforms and can target many common Cortex-M and Cortex-A controllers.

Since I got several of the RobotDyn boards, I figured I could spare one for a
debugging platform. Building BMP for it was fairly straightforward:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic && cd blackmagic
$ make ENABLE_DEBUG=1 PROBE_HOST=swlink
...
  OBJCOPY blackmagic.bin
...
  OBJCOPY blackmagic_dfu.bin
...
```

This gave me both `src/blackmagic_dfu.bin` and `src/blackmagic.bin`. The DFU
binary is a bootloader that allows upgrading the probe over USB rather than
having to break out the USB-TTL cable every time. As with the blink program,
flashing it was as easy as

```bash
$ stm32flash -w src/blackmagic_dfu.bin -v /dev/ttyUSB0
...
Wrote and verified address 0x08001c4c (100.00%) Done.
```

Again, BOOT0 must be jumpered high for this.

From there, everything else could be done over USB with BOOT0 held low!

An interesting quirk of the STM32F103C8 chips is that, while they're only
declared to have 64KB of flash, [nearly all of them in reality have
128KB](https://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill#128_KB_flash_on_C8_version).
This isn't guaranteed, YMMV, etc., but for my purposes, this is great news,
considering that BMP takes more than 64KB. `dfu-util`, unfortunately, will
respect the announced 64KB limit and will refuse to flash the
`blackmagic.bin`.

```bash
$ dfu-util -d 1d50:6018,:6017 -s 0x08002000:leave -D src/blackmagic.bin
...
dfu-util: Last page at 0x08015f67 is not writeable
```

Fortunately, there's a script in the BMP project
(`scripts/stm32_mem.py`) that disregards the announced memory.

```bash
$ ./scripts/stm32_mem.py src/blackmagic.bin

Now we have a fully functional BMP debugger!

## Debugging Some Code

*Now* the real fun begins. The BMP reuses the SWD pins at the opposite
side of the board form the USB port for its own connection to targets that
are begin debugged. This makes connecting everything fairly straightforward.
SWDIO to SWDIO, SWCLK to SWCLK, etc. Since the BMP provides power to the
target, no additional connections are strictly necessary aside from
Host&nbsp;USB->BMP and BMP->Target&nbsp;SWD.

{{ image(path="connection.jpg", alt="Debugger Connection") }}

In this picture, my debugger is the one without the full headers and with the
boot pins pulled permanently low.

When the BMP is plugged into the host computer, it shows up as two CDC ACM
devices - effectively two serial devices. The first is the debugging
interface and the second is its USB->Serial adapter. We're just going to
worry about the debugger for now.

The debugger runs its own GDB server, so attaching to it only requires the
appropriate GDB.

```bash
$  arm-none-eabi-gdb target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/blink
(gdb) target extended-remote /dev/ttyACM0
Remote debugging using /dev/ttyACM0
```

And now we're connected to the BMP! Attaching to the target is equally simple:

```bash
(gdb) monitor swdp_scan # First scan for connected targets.
Target voltage: ABSENT!
Available Targets:
No. Att Driver
 1      STM32F1 medium density
(gdb) attach 1 # attach to the one we found
Attaching to program: /data/home/jchase/src/gitlab.com/jrobsonchase/blink/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/blink, Remote target
0x08000298 in main () at src/main.rs:46
46              block!(timer.wait()).unwrap();
```

Note that it pauses whatever is currently running on the target. Since it's
the program that I'd loaded previously, I get source/line information, but
you may not if you haven't loaded anything yet, or if the code on the
controller differs from the binary you're using.

Loading new code onto it is also easy:

```bash
(gdb) load
Loading section .vector_table, size 0xc0 lma 0x8000000
Loading section .text, size 0x259c lma 0x80000c0
Loading section .rodata, size 0x1d40 lma 0x8002660
Start address 0x800084c, load size 17308
Transfer rate: 17 KB/sec, 910 bytes/write.
```

And then, of course, running!

```bash
(gdb) run
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /data/home/jchase/src/gitlab.com/jrobsonchase/blink/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/blink 
```

Interrupting the program and adding breakpoints all work pretty much as
expected, which blew my mind!

```rust
(gdb) break main.rs:42
Breakpoint 1 at 0x800028a: file src/main.rs, line 42.
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
Note: automatically using hardware breakpoints for read-only addresses.

Breakpoint 1, main () at src/main.rs:42
42              led.set_high();
(gdb) list
37          let mut led = gpioc.pc13.into_push_pull_output(&mut gpioc.crh);
38          // Try a different timer (even SYST)
39          let mut timer = Timer::syst(cp.SYST, 1.hz(), clocks);
40          loop {
41              block!(timer.wait()).unwrap();
42              led.set_high();
43              block!(timer.wait()).unwrap();
44              led.set_low();
45          }
46      }
(gdb) info locals
timer = <a very long type> # edited for brevity
led = <a very long type> # edited for brevity
gpioc = <optimized out>
clocks = <a very long type> # edited for brevity
rcc = <a very long type> # edited for brevity
flash = <optimized out>
dp = <optimized out>
cp = <optimized out>
```

This can be integrated into the Cargo workflow via the `.cargo/config`:

```toml
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -x bmp-connect.gdb -ex run"
```

`bmp-connect.gdb`:

```
target extended-remote /dev/ttyACM0
monitor swdp_scan
attach 1

set print asm-demangle on

break DefaultHandler
break UserHardFault
break rust_begin_unwind

load
```

and then the program can be flashed and executed with just `cargo run`!

### IDE Integration

Debugging via the GDB cli is cool, but I wanted to take it a step further and
get it all working through my IDE, VSCode. Luckily, there's an extension that
makes it pretty trivial - [Cortex
Debug](https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug). After installing it, an entry
in the `launch.json` can be created:

```json
{
    "name": "Cortex Debug",
    "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
    "preLaunchTask": "build debug",
    "executable": "${workspaceRoot}/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/blink",
    "request": "launch",
    "type": "cortex-debug",
    "BMPGDBSerialPort": "/dev/ttyACM0",
    "device": "stm32f103xx",
    "servertype": "bmp"
}
```

Some things to note here are my `"preLaunchTask"` which runs a debug build task defined as:

```json
{
    "label": "build debug",
    "command": "cargo",
    "args": [
        "build"
    ],
    "problemMatcher": [
        "$rustc"
    ],
    "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
    }
}
```

and also the `"device"` entry, which allows the debugger to display the device peripherals.

With this, everything "Just Works!"
